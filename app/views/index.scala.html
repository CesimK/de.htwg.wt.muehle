                    The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces,
                    or "men", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined
                    horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. <br>

                    A player wins by reducing
                    the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving
                    them without a legal move.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The game proceeds in three phases:
                    <br>&nbsp; 1. Placing men on vacant points
                    <br>&nbsp; 2. Moving men to adjacent points
                    <br>&nbsp; 3. (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men
