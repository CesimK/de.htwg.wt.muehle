                The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces,
                or "men", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined
                horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. <br>

                A player wins by reducing
                the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving
                them without a legal move.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game proceeds in three phases:

                <br> 1. Placing men on vacant points
                <br> 2. Moving men to adjacent points
                <br> 3. (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men

                This is a Project developed for the lecture Web Technologies. Goal of this lecture is it, to create a fully working Web-Application,
                of our previously developed game (from the lecture Software Engineering):
